#Pig Latin Encryption

Thanks - my name is Willem Larsen and the goal of this project is to create a javascript encryption tool for converting words and sentences into Pig Latin via  a web page.

Currently it only does single words; I still am puzzling over how to search entire sentences and paragraphs with a regex.

Thanks for your interest!
